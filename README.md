A Novel Approach to Improve Binary Classification Problem
This project proposes an ensemble method to improve the performance of binary classification problems.
I Firstly have used multiple single models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) and have compared their performance or f1 score and have found best one in single models (at different test sizes 10%, 30%, 50%).
Then I have used Ensemble learning techniques (Bagging, Boosting and Voting), and compared their f1 score and have found the best one.
The experiment results shows improvement on F1 score, compared to the best individual model.
